# Hangman.py
In case you've been living under a rock: Hangman is a game where you try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn, representing the "hangman." The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.
